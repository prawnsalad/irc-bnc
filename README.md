# irc-bnc
Extensible IRC Bouncer


## Status
This project is currently in development and shouldn't be used in production anywhere. Things are changing, ideas are still being played around with.


The source is currently littered with TODO comments with changes and not-implemented sections. This will be a good way to determine how much is yet to be changed.

Main todo:
* Document application structure
* Document method APIs
* Decide on a configuaration file
* Impliment admin user roles
* Structure a standalone bootup script (`server.js`)
* Document and structure an API to be integrated into external applications


### Misc
Storage + client interface design [here](docs/extending.md)
